# BR AI and Automation Lab: Satellite Imagery

## Project Description

The Goal of this Project was to locate Urban Heat Islands in a given City, and to analyse their development over time, as well as the corresponding development of vegetation and soil moisture for the located areas. For this purpose, a data pipeline that can fetch batches of satellite imagery on arbitrary locations was built. After fetching data, functions for calculation the metrics of interest (i.e. [Landsurface Temperature!](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/using-usgs-landsat-level-1-data-product), NDVI and NDWI)
